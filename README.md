This is an API mod I created for my other mods. A total of 5 main materials have been added: Silver, Steel, Black Copper, Mithril, and Orichalcum, along with their related secondary materials and blocks. In addition, it also introduces a new type of damage: Soul Damage, and a combat system inspired by “The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim”.
# How to Use My API?
Firstly:You need add the JitPack repository to your build file
```java
<repositories>
		<repository>
		    <id>jitpack.io</id>
		    <url>https://jitpack.io</url>
		</repository>
	</repositories>
```
Secondly: Add the dependency
```java
<dependency>
	    <groupId>com.github.CJiangqiu</groupId>
	    <artifactId>Epic-Core-API-Remote-Workspace</artifactId>
	    <version>1.20.1</version>
	</dependency>
 ```
